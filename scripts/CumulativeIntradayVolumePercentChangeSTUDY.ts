# CumulativeIntradayVolumePercentChange
#
# Displays a chart with the percent change in cumulative intraday volume. 
#
# The chart period should be less than one day.
#
# This study was designed to be used with TOS Total Volume symbols like $TVOLC/Q 
# (NASDAQ Composite Total Volume) or $TVOLC (NYSE Composite Total volume). The 
# OHLC "prices" for these symbols are actually cumulative daily volume. But this
# study will show price percent change over the same time period if a stock or
# ETF symbol is used.
