## Features

The scripts include:

* ATRPercent - Displays a chart showing the Average True Range over time as a percent of price.

* ATRWithGapUpIndicator - Displays a chart showing the Average True Range over time as a percent of price.  Large gaps up are highlighted in green.

* BuyableGapUpIndicator - Adds a chart bubble indicating past buyable gaps-up.

* CoppockIndicator - Displays a chart of Coppock Indicator with bubbles at each buy signal.

* CumulativeIntradayVolumePercentChange - Displays a chart of the percent change in volume since 1 market session ago. Intended to be used with volume symbols like $TVOLC/Q (NASDAQ Composite Total Volume) or $TVOLC (NYSE Composite Total volume).
